Libsmb2 components fall under two separate licences


The lib and include directories
===============================
The smb2 client library itself, i.e. the lib and include directories,
is licenced under GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

A copy of LGPL 2.1 is included in the file LICENCE-LGPL-2.1.txt but can also be downloaded from http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html

This is the licence that applies to the libsmb2 library and its use.



The examples directory
======================
The example applications using this library, i.e. the examples directory,
is licenced under 2-Clause BSD License.

These are executable applications that link with the libsmb2 library.

To avoid any confusion, every source file also contain a licence boilerplate.
